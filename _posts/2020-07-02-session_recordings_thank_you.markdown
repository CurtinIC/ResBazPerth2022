And that's a wrap on ResBaz Perth 2022!!

Thank you to our amazing volunteers, presenters, helpers, organisers and participants!

We had 25+ speakers 20+ helpers deliver over 40 hours of content this past week, with over 800 registrations from nearly 350 individuals!

Links to session recordings are being updated on [the SESSIONS page](/ResBazPerth2022/sessions/) as they become available.

Look for the recording links on the session of interest, but please note that recordings are not available for all sessions.

Thank you, and we'll see you (hopefully in person) next year!
